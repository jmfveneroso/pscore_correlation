abstract = {Bibliometric measures of individual scientific achievement are of particular interest if they can be used to predict future achievement. Here we report results of an empirical study of the predictive power of the h index compared with other indicators. Our findings indicate that the h index is better than other indicators considered (total citation count, citations per paper, and total paper count) in predicting future scientific achievement. We discuss reasons for the superiority of the h index.},

abstract = {Assessing the quality of scientific conferences is an important and useful service that can be provided by digital libraries and similar systems. This is specially true for fields such as Computer Science and Electric Engineering, where conference publications are crucial. However, the majority of the existing approaches for assessing the quality of publication venues has been proposed for journals. In this paper, we characterize a large number of features that can be used as criteria to assess the quality of scientific conferences and study how these several features can be automatically combined by means of machine learning techniques to effectively perform this task. Within the features studied are citations, submission and acceptance rates, tradition of the conference, and reputation of the program committee members. Among our several findings, we can cite that: (1) separating high quality conferences from medium and low quality ones can be performed quite effectively, but separating the last two types is a much harder task; and (2) citation features followed by those associated with the tradition of the conference are the most important ones for the task.},

abstract = {The online availability of scientific-literature databases and natural-language-processing (NLP) algorithms has enabled large-scale bibliometric studies within the field of scientometrics. Using NLP techniques and Thomson ISI reports, an initial analysis of the role of Alzheimer's disease (AD) within the neurosciences as well as a summary of the various research foci within the AD scientific community are presented. Citation analyses and productivity filters are applied to post-1984, AD-specific subsets of the PubMed and Thomson ISI Web-of-Science literature bases to algorithmically identify a pool of the top AD researchers. From the initial pool of AD investigators, top-100 rankings are compiled to assess productivity and impact. One of the impact and productivity metrics employed is an AD-specific H-index. Within the AD-specific H-index ranking, there are many cases of multiple AD investigators with similar or identical H-indices. In order to facilitate differentiation among investigators with equal or near-equal H indices, two derivatives of the H-index are proposed: the Second-Tier H-index and the Scientific Following H-index. Winners of two prestigious AD-research awards are highlighted, membership to the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences is acknowledged, and an analysis of highly-productive, high-impact, AD-research collaborations is presented.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Impact factor, an index based on the frequency with which a journal's articles are cited in scientific publications, is a putative marker of journal quality. However, empiric studies on impact factor's validity as an indicator of quality are lacking. The authors assessed the validity of impact factor as a measure of quality for general medical journals by testing its association with journal quality as rated by clinical practitioners and researchers. METHODS: We surveyed physicians specializing in internal medicine in the United States, randomly sampled from the American Medical Association's Physician Masterfile (practitioner group, n = 113) and from a list of graduates from a national postdoctoral training program in clinical and health services research (research group, n = 151). Respondents rated the quality of nine general medical journals, and we assessed the correlation between these ratings and the journals' impact factors. RESULTS: The correlation between impact factor and physicians' ratings of journal quality was strong (r2 = 0.82, P = 0.001). The correlation was higher for the research group (r2 = 0.83, P = 0.001) than for the practitioner group (r2 = 0.62, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Impact factor may be a reasonable indicator of quality for general medical journals.},

abstract = {The rank of a journal based on simple citation information is a popular measure. The simplicity and availability of rankings such as Impact Factor, Eigenfactor and SciMago Journal Rank based on trusted commercial sources ensures their widespread use for many important tasks despite the well-known limitations of such rankings. In this paper we look at an alternative approach based on information on papers from social and mainstream media sources. Our data comes from altmetric.com who identify mentions of individual academic papers in sources such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs and news outlets. We consider several different methods to produce a ranking of journals from such data. We show that most (but not all) schemes produce results, which are roughly similar, suggesting that there is a basic consistency between social media based approaches and traditional citation based methods. Most ranking schemes applied to one data set produce relatively little variation and we suggest this provides a measure of the uncertainty in any journal rating. The differences we find between data sources also shows they are capturing different aspects of journal impact. We conclude a small number of such ratings will provide the best information on journal impact.},

Given the shortage of both in typical situations, a researcher's productivity is often judged quantitatively by the number of publications, their acceptance ratios, and citation counts that are highly discipline-dependent. We believe such a cursory evaluation is unavoidable and suggest a more intuitive discipline-agnostic approach for perfunctory assessment. We propose a metric called peers' reputation (PR) which ties the selectivity of a publication venue with the reputations of authors' institutions. Briefly, PR conveys the selectivity of a conference with a tuple, say},

@article{Balaban2012,
abstract = {The Hirsch citation index h is nowadays the most frequently used numerical indicator for the performance of scientists as reflected in their output and in the reaction of the scientific community reflected in citations of individual contributions. A few of the possible improvements of h are briefly reviewed. Garfield's journal impact factor (IF) characterizes the reaction of the scientific community to publications in journals, reflected in citations of all papers published in any given journal during the preceding 2 years, and normalized against all citable articles during the same period. Again, a few of the possible improvements or supplements of IF are briefly reviewed, including the journal-h index proposed by Braun, Glanzel, and Schubert. Ascribing higher weighting factors to citations of individual papers proportionally to IF is considered to be a misuse of useful numerical indices based on citations. At most, one could turn this argument on its head and one can find reasons to ascribe an inverse proportionality relative to IF for individual citations: if a paper is considered worthy to be cited even if it was published in a low-IF journal, that citation ought to be worth more than if the citation would have been from a higher-impact journal. A weight factor reflecting the prestige of the citing author(s) may also be considered.},

But for all such metrics, context is critical. Many citations are used simply to flesh out a paper's introduction, having no real significance to the work. Citations are also sometimes made in a negative context, or to fraudulent or retracted publications. Other confounding factors include the practice of 'gratuitous authorship' and the so-called 'Matthew effect', whereby well-established researchers and projects are cited disproportionately more often than those that are less widely known.

The past decade has witnessed tremendous interest, and a wealth of results, in expertise retrieval as an emerging subdiscipline in information retrieval. This survey highlights advances in models and algorithms relevant to this field. We draw connections among methods proposed in the literature and summarize them in five groups of basic approaches. These serve as the building blocks for more advanced models that arise when we consider a range of content-based factors that may impact the strength of association between a topic and a person. We also discuss practical aspects of building an expert search system and present applications of the technology in other domains, such as blog distillation and entity retrieval. The limitations of current approaches are also pointed out. We end our survey with a set of conjectures on what the future may hold for expertise retrieval research.},

In this paper, we propose and develop a flexible data schema and a topic-sensitive co-pagerank algorithmcombinedwith a topic model for solving this problem. The main idea is to measure the authors' authorities by considering topic bias based on their social networks and citation networks, and then, rec- ommending expert candidates for the questions. To infer the association between authors and topics, we draw a probabil- ity model from the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. We further propose several techniques such as reasoning the interested topics of the query and integrating ranking met- rics to order the practices. Our experiments show that the proposed strategies are all effective to improve the retrieval accuracy},

abstract = {Recently expertise retrieval has received increasing inter- ests in both academia and industry. Finding experts with demonstrated expertise for a given query is a nontrivial task especially from a large-scaleWeb 2.0 systems, such as ques- tion answering and bibliography data, where users are ac- tively publishing useful content online, interacting with each other, and forming social networks in various ways, leading to heterogeneous networks in addition to the large amounts of textual content information. Many approaches have been proposed and shown to be useful for expertise ranking. How- ever, most of these methods only consider the textual doc- uments while ignoring heterogeneous network structures or canmerely integrate with one additional kind of information. None of them can fully exploit the characteristics of hetero- geneous networks. In this paper, we propose a joint regular- ization framework to enhance expertise retrieval by model- ing heterogeneous networks as regularization constraints on top of document-centric model. We argue that multi-typed linking edges reveal valuable information which should be treated differently. Motivated by this intuition, we formu- late three hypotheses to capture unique characteristics for different graphs, and mathematically model those hypothe- ses jointly with the document and other information. To illustrate our methodology, we apply the framework to ex- pert finding applications using a bibliography dataset with 1.1million papers and 0.7million authors. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can achieve signif- icantly better results than the baseline and other enhanced models.},

abstract = {We present the problem of finding comparable researchers for any given researcher. This problem has many motivations. Firstly, know thyself. The answers of where we stand among research community and who we are most alike may not be easily found by existing evaluations of ones' research mainly based on citation counts. Secondly, there are many situations where one needs to find comparable researchers e.g., for reviewing peers, constructing programming committees or compiling teams for grants. It is often done through an ad hoc and informal basis. Utilizing the large scale scholarly data accessible on the web, we address the problem of automatically finding comparable researchers. We propose a standard to quantify the quality of research output, via the quality of publishing venues. We represent a researcher as a sequence of her publication records, and develop a framework of comparison of researchers by sequence matching. Several variations of comparisons are considered including matching by quality of publication venue and research topics, and performing prefix matching. We evaluate our methods on a large corpus and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through examples. In the end, we identify several promising directions for further work.},

If this set is ranked in decreasing order of the number of citations that they received, the g-index is the (unique) largest number such that the top g articles received (together) at least g2 citations. We prove the unique existence of g for any set of articles and we have that g â‰¥ h. The general Lotkaian theory of the g-index is presented and we show that âˆ’1 1 ? âˆ’ 1 ? g = $\alpha$$\alpha$ $\alpha$ $\alpha$ ? ? T $\alpha$ ? âˆ’ 2 ? where $\alpha$ {\textgreater} 2 is the Lotkaian exponent and where T denotes the total number of sources. We then present the g-index of the (still active) Price medallists for their complete careers up to 1972 and compare it with the h-index. It is shown that the g-index inherits all the good properties of the h-index and, in addition, better takes into account the citation scores of the top articles. This yields a better distinction between and order of the scientists from the point of view of visibility.},

abstract = {One interesting phenomenon that emerges from the typical structure of social networks is the friendship paradox. It states that your friends have on average more friends than you do. Recent efforts have explored variations of it, with numerous implications for the dynamics of social networks. However, the friendship paradox and its variations consider only the topological structure of the networks and neglect many other characteristics that are correlated with node degree. In this article, we take the case of scientific collaborations to investigate whether a similar paradox also arises in terms of a researcher's scientific productivity as measured by her H-index. The H-index is a widely used metric in academia to capture both the quality and the quantity of a researcher's scientific output. It is likely that a researcher may use her coauthors' H-indexes as a way to infer whether her own H-index is adequate in her research area. Nevertheless, in this article, we show that the average H-index of a researcher's coauthors is usually higher than her own H-index. We present empirical evidence of this paradox and discuss some of its potential consequences.},

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from 3 years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine - the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections, where anyone can publish anything they want. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this study was thus to assess experimentally whether the peripersonal (PPS) and interpersonal space (IPS) represent a similar psychological entity. Were this true, they should share some functional features. Here we tested tool-use dependent plasticity, known to modulate PPS, but still unexplored in the IPS. Results from two experiments converge in showing that tool-use remapped the action-related PPS, measured by a Reaching-distance toward a confederate, but did not affect the social-related IPS, measured by a Comfort-distance task. These findings indicate that PPS and IPS rely on dissociable plastic mechanisms and suggest that, at least in the present experimental conditions, there is no full functional overlap between these two spatial representations.},

Almost simultaneously, at nearby Stanford University, two Computer Science doctoral students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, are putting the finishing touches on their PageRank algorithm, a future core component of Google's search engine. Both projects are based on an innovative idea: using the hyperlink structure of the web to enhance a search engine's results.},
