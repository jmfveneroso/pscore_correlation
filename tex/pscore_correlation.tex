\abstract{The notions of reputation and popularity in academia are critical for taking 
decisions on research grants, faculty position tenure, and research excellence awards. 
These notions are almost always associated with the publication track 
records of the researchers. Thus, it is important to assess 
publication track records quantitatively. To quantify a publication record, 
bibliographic metrics are usually adopted. Among these, citation based metrics
such as the H-index are frequently considered. 
In this paper we study the correlation between P-score, a publication record metric 
we introduced previously, and H-index. While H-indices reflect the popularity of a given
publication or researcher in academia, P-scores reflect the reputation of a publication or
researcher among its peers. And while popularity and reputation are frequently considered 
to be equivalent properties, they are not identical. Indeed, 
we first show that H-indices and P-scores are correlated with a Kendall-Tau coefficient 
that exceeds 0.5. However, we also notice that they have important differences. 
Particularly, we identify publication venues with high H-indices and low 
P-scores, as well as venues with low H-indices and high P-scores. We provide interpretations 
for these findings and discuss how they can be used by research funding councils and committees
to better support their funding decisions.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Academic research evaluation is a topic of interest to universities, research groups,
research funding institutions, and the public at large. It is used to decide laboratory space
allocation, research grants, tenure track, university choice by students, and more. It also 
has a direct impact on the reputation of the university or institution before society, which
affects the ability of the institution to attract the best possible talent. While evaluation of
academic research is complex, usually a function of multiple variables, a dominant variable in
most evaluation procedures is the research output of the institution. In particular, considerable
emphasis is given to the papers published by the professors and students of the institution, as
well as the quality of these papers in terms of their impact on scientific knowledge. A rather
popular approach to evaluate publication impact is to compare journals, conferences or papers
through the usage of academic impact metrics. A popular and moderately effective approach is to
compute metrics based on the number of citations received by a given piece of research and
assume that the number of citations is a good proxy for research quality. However,
this approach has multiple shortcomings. 

First, in the evaluation and bibliometrics research communities, citations are understood
as a measure of attention rather than a proxy for impact or quality. Citations measure 
the attention to a paper of peers in related fields~\cite{Loach2015}, not the quality of the 
work produced. Second, citations can take a long time to happen. To illustrate this, in a recent
study that looked at first time to citation in a universe of more than a million papers, half the 
papers only received their first citation 20 months or more after they were
published~\cite{Nane2012}. Third, citations are not simple to compute and are not always broadly
available, particularly at the level of individual researchers.

Despite these limitations, citation based metrics continue to be a popular approach to
academic research evaluation~\cite{Kellner2008}.
Nonetheless, it is desirable to employ
complementary metrics that tackle the exposed problems without loss of effectiveness.

Academic reputation is an individual or group property strongly associated with 
academic impact, and while being similar it is not identical to academic popularity. An 
actor's popularity depends solely on the the total number of endorsements
the actor receives from other actors, while its reputation or prestige depends on the 
reputations of the endorsing actors~\cite{Bollen2006}. Reputable venues tend to 
concentrate the most relevant research papers 
because that is how they acquire and keep their good reputations. At the same time, 
reputable authors seek to publish on reputable venues because it gives their 
research more visibility and accreditation. Therefore, researchers convey reputation
to a venue proportionally to their own reputation and the reputation of researchers
is proportional to the reputation of the venues where they publish.
This relationship between authors and venues constitutes a reputation network in which 
authors influence venue reputations and vice versa. 

{\em P-score}~\cite{Ribas2015a} is a graph-based modeling metric that attributes quantitative
reputations to venues based on the publication patterns of a reference group of researchers,
without relying on citation information. It deals with the three problems discussed previously. 

First, instead of measuring the amount of researcher attention, P-score measures reputations
which, under certain assumptions, provide a better proxy for academic impact as was shown by~\citeA{Ribas2015a}. Second, while citations can take years to happen, reputations 
tend to be established earlier on. As a consequence, the quality of new research can be 
promptly estimated using P-scores computed on the newest publication data. Third, P-scores do
not require citation data to be computed, which means that they can be recomputed quickly whenever one finds fit or convenient.

Our interpretation of these results are based on the intuition that while H-indices provide a 
quantification of the popularity of a publication or researcher among their peers, P-scores 
provide a quantification of the reputation of a publication or researcher among peers. When
P-scores and H-indices are strongly correlated, we have venues that are popular and of high
reputation among computer scientists. Second, when P-scores are large (better rank position) 
and H-indices are small (worse rank position) we have venues of good reputation among computer
scientists that are associated with small research communities or subareas and are thus less popular. Third, when P-scores
are small (worse rank position) and H-indices are large (better rank position) we have venues of good popularity 
(usually associated with large research communities inside Computer Science) that do not count
with high reputation among computer scientists (in the sense that they do not publish frequently 
there).

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}

Quantitative metrics of scientific impact have a long history. An influential approach is
Garfield's Impact Factor~\cite{Garfield1955a}, a journal-level metric that is defined
by the mean number of citations received by articles published in a given journal over a 2-year period. 
Despite being one of the earliest approaches at measuring scientific impact, it has showed remarkable 
survivability. 
\citeA{Pinski1976} describe several limitations with the metric. Impact factors also suffered 
criticism for being misleading~\cite{Nature2016, Saha2003} and for lacking reliable validation from an independent 
audit~\cite{Rossner2007}. \citeA{Riikonen2008} showed that actual citation 
and publication counts were better predictors of a scientist's contribution than impact factors in a 
study that assessed the scientific contribution of Finnish researchers in biomedicine.

The acceptance rate is another important journal-level metric that attempts to quantify the scientific impact. It
is defined by the proportion of accepted papers relative to the number of submitted papers. \citeA{Chen2010} 
have shown that highly selective conferences, the ones having low acceptance rates, have higher 
scientific impact, measured in terms of the number of citations received by the published papers.

The H-index is an author-level metric proposed by~\citeA{Hirsch2005}. Since its formulation, it has been 
widely adopted as a measure of individual scientific research output.
The H-index takes into account both the number of publications and the number of citations per publication, 
achieving higher values when a researcher obtains a consistently high number of citations over multiple publications. 
The H-index has been criticized for not taking into account field specific citation
statistics~\cite{Wendl2007}. The G-index, proposed by~\citeA{Egghe2006}, is a less strict variation 
of the H-index.

Citation counts and derived metrics are straightforward to calculate, but they represent only a coarse
estimate of academic impact, because they are essentially popularity measures. Some people are popular but not 
prestigious and vice versa. For example, an author of pulp detectives may sell many books, but may not have earned 
the respect of literary critics~\cite{Bollen2006}. Citations from 
prestigious journals are more relevant than citations from peripheral journals, as noted by~\citeA{Pinski1976}. To address this issue, some studies distinguish popularity from 
reputation or prestige with the usage of citation weighting strategies~\cite{Ding2011, Yan2011a} or 
Page Rank based methods~\cite{Bollen2006, Sun2007}. 
Furthermore,~\citeA{Piwowar2013} noted that citation based metrics are slow, since the 
first citation to a scientific article can take years to happen, concluding that the development of 
alternative metrics to complement citation analysis is not only desirable, but a necessity.
As discussed by~\citeA{Leydesdorff2009}, each metric has advantages and disadvantages deriving from their 
inherent biases.

\citeA{Martins2009} proposed a method of assessing the quality of scientific conferences 
through a machine learning classifier that makes use of multiple features in addition to citations.
\citeA{Goncalves2014} quantified the impact of various features on a 
scholar's popularity. They concluded that, even though most of the considered features are strongly correlated 
with popularity, only two features are needed to explain almost all the variation in popularity between different 
researchers: the number of publications and the average quality of the scholar‚Äôs publication venues. 

The idea of reputation, without the direct use of citation data, was discussed by~\citeA{Nelakuditi2011}. They proposed a metric called \textit{peers' reputation} for 
research conferences and journals, which ties the selectivity of the publication venue based upon 
the reputation of its authors' institutions. The proposed metric was shown to be a better indicator 
of the selectivity of a research venue than the acceptance ratio.

\section{P-score: a network-based metric} 
\label{pscore} 

Contrary to citation counting metrics such as the Impact 
Factor~\cite{Garfield1955a, Saha2003, Thomson2017, Balaban2012} and 
H-index~\cite{Benevenuto2016, Bar-Ilan2008, Egghe2008, Bornmann2005, Bornmann2011}, 
P-scores are a graph-based modeling metric that takes into account 
the relations among researchers, papers they published and their publication venues. They are 
based on a framework of reputation flows we introduced previously~\cite{Ribas2015}. Let us review 
them briefly. 

A \emph{reputation graph} in academia is a graph with three node types: (a) {\em reputation sources} representing groups of selected researchers, 
(b) {\em reputation targets} representing venues of interest, and
(c) {\em reputation collaterals} representing entities we want to compare such as research groups and academic 
departments. 
Figure~\ref{fig:overview} provides a generic illustration of our reputation graph and introduces the following 
notation: $S$ is the set of reputation sources, $T$ is the set of reputation targets, and $C$ is the set of reputation collaterals.
We first propagate the reputation of source nodes to target nodes, which allows assigning 
weights to the target nodes. Following, we propagate these weights to the collaterals. 
In here we adopt research groups as source nodes and publication venues as target nodes. 
Further we focus on the weights assigned to the publication venues and do not consider 
potential collaterals of interest (such as individual researchers). 

\begin{figure}[h]
   \centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{overview-line}}
   %\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/models/overview}}
   \caption{Structure of the reputation graph.}
   \label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

Our reputation graph for academia can be naturally associated with paper authors, 
modelled as reputation sources, and papers, modelled as reputation targets. 
The interaction between reputation sources and reputation targets is inspired by the 
notion of {\em eigenvalue centrality} in complex 
networks~\cite{Brin1998, Langville2008, Langville2008, Newman2010}. 
In the reputation graph, if we consider only sources and targets, it is easy to 
identify reputation flows from sources to sources, from sources to targets, from 
targets to sources, and from targets to targets. These reputation flows can be 
modeled as a stochastic process. 
In particular, let $P$ be a \emph{right stochastic} %\footnote{A right stochastic matrix is ...} 
matrix of size $(|S|+|T|) \times (|S|+|T|)$ with the following structure: 

\newcommand{\bkt}[1]{ {^{\langle #1 \rangle}} }

\begin{align}\label{eq:newp}
%\[
P =
\left[
\begin{array}{r | r}
(d\bkt{S}) . P\bkt{SS}  & (1-d\bkt{S}) . P\bkt{ST} \\
\hline
(1-d\bkt{T}) . P\bkt{TS}  & (d\bkt{T}) . P\bkt{TT} \\
\end{array}
\right]
%\]
\end{align}
\noindent where each quadrant represents a distinct type of reputation flow, as follows: 

\begin{description}
\item $P\bkt{SS}$: right stochastic matrix of size $|S|\times |S|$ representing the transition probabilities between reputation sources;
\item $P\bkt{ST}$: matrix of size $|S|\times |T|$ representing the transition probabilities from reputation sources to targets;
\item $P\bkt{TS}$: matrix of size $|T|\times |S|$ representing the transition probabilities from reputation targets to sources;
\item $P\bkt{TT}$: right stochastic matrix of size $|T|\times |T|$ representing the transition probabilities between reputation targets.
\end{description}

The parameters $d\bkt{S}$, the fraction of reputation one wants to transfer among the source nodes themselves, 
and $d\bkt{T}$, the fraction of reputation one wants to transfer among the target nodes themselves,
control the relative importance of the reputation sources and targets. 
Assuming that the transition matrix $P$ is ergodic, we can compute the steady state probability of each node and use it as a reputation score. 
More formally, we can write: 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ggP}
\gamma = \gamma P
\end{align}
\noindent where $\gamma$ is a row matrix with $|S|+|T|$ elements, 
where each row represents the transition probabilities of a node in the set $S\cup T$. 

We should note that, while our network model allows modeling citations in the fourth quadrant, it is possible to compute 
steady state probabilities for the network without consideration to citations. This is accomplished by setting the parameter 
$d\bkt{T} = 0$. 
Thus, it should be clear that in all experiments described in this work, P-scores 
are computed without taking citations into account.

\subsection{Reputation Sources}
\label{sec:rep-sources}

The choice of the reputation sources is an important part of the method since its composition has a direct impact on the final rankings. There is no definitive way to make it. This choice depends on what we want to measure. In this work, we 
use the top CS departments in the US as reputation sources. It is a simple procedure that allows assigning P-scores 
to publication venues, P-scores that 
reflect the publication patterns of top CS departments in the US. 
We then compare how these scores compare with H-indices assigned to the same publication venues. 

One way to determine the top CS departments is to 
adopt a randomization procedure. A run of that 
procedure works as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item randomly select 10 entities from the set of reputation targets and use them as the set $S$ of reputation sources
\item compute steady state probabilities for all nodes
\item using the steady state probabilities of reputation targets as a score, select the 10 entities with highest scores and use them as a new set $S_{new}$ of reputation sources
\item if $S_{new} \not \equiv S$ then $S \leftarrow S_{new}$ and go back to step 1
\item $S_{auto} \leftarrow S_{new}$ 
\item take $S_{auto}$ as the set of automatically selected reputation sources
\item exit
\end{enumerate}
By applying this randomization procedure 100 times to a set of 126 US graduate programs in Computer Science (CS), 
exactly the same 126 graduate programs considered by NRC in its 2011 evaluation of CS graduate programs 
in the USA \footnote{http://www.nap.edu/rdp/}, we ended up with a subset of 12 CS programs to be considered as reputation sources. 
These are the CS programs that appeared as least once in the set $S_{auto}$ of automatically selected reputation 
sources and they are as follows: 

\begin{table}[h!]
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{l l} 
 \toprule
 \# & Department \\ 
 \midrule
 1  & Carnegie Mellon University \\
 2  & Georgia Institute of Technology \\
 3  & Massachusetts Institute of Technology \\
 4  & Stanford University \\
 5  & University of California-Berkeley \\
 6  & University of California-Los Angeles \\
 7  & University of California-San Diego \\
 8  & University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign \\
 9  & University of Maryland College Park \\
 10 & University of Southern California \\
 11 & University of Michigan-Ann Arbor \\
 12 & Cornell University \\
 \bottomrule
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{Reputation sources obtained with the randomization procedure.}
 \label{tab:departments}
\end{table}

All the 12 departments above are among the top 5th percentile in the ranking produced by NRC. 
This suggests that our recursive procedure is able to take advantage of patterns in the publication 
streams of the various CS departments to determine the most reputable ones in fully automatic fashion.
We further observe that this was done while setting the parameter $d\bkt{T} = 0$. That is, we did 
not use information on citation counts in the model. 

\section{Correlation with H-indices} 
\label{sec:correlation}

The H-index~\cite{Hirsch2005} is a composite metric of lifelong scientific contribution that takes 
into account the productivity of researchers and the citation impact of their publications.
A researcher has an H-index value of $ h $ if she has $ h $ publications that have been cited at 
least $ h $ times. For example, if a researcher has published 20 papers that received at least 20 
citations each, then her H-index is 20, assuming that 20 is the highest number for which the 
definition of the H-index holds. A journal's H-index can be computed 
in the same way by considering all publications and their collective citation data over a 
definite period as suggested by~\citeA{Braun2006}.
Since H-index was proposed in 2005, the original paper by~\citeA{Hirsch2005} was 
cited 7,949 times, which attests to its popularity 
\footnote{According to Google Scholar, up to the end of 2017.}.

As any scientific impact metric, the H-index has advantages and disadvantages. 
Some of its advantages are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The simplicity and intuitiveness of its formulation.
\item The longer citation time window when compared to impact factors.
\item H-index has a good predictive power regarding scientific achievement~\cite{Bornmann2005, Hirsch2007}.
\end{itemize}

H-index depends on citations to be calculated, thus it suffers from the 
same problems as any other citation-based metrics. Some of its major disadvantages are:

\begin{itemize}
\item H-index does not distinguish citations from prestigious and peripheral journals, thus 
it measures popularity rather than quality.
\item The time to first citation can be very long.
\item It is not easy to collect all relevant information.
\item H-index is field-dependent~\cite{Wendl2007}.
\item Major sources do not always agree on its value~\cite{Bar-Ilan2008}. 
\end{itemize}

We propose to use P-score as a complementary metric to deal with some of the problems
presented by citation-based metrics such as the H-index.
P-score is a metric of reputation among peers based on the publication pattern of a set of
reference groups of researchers, the reference seeds. It differs from other network-based 
metrics because the venues' reputations derive exclusively from the reference seeds, which 
allows better control of the actual reputation flows. Additionally, to calculate P-scores we 
do not need citation data, which make P-scores easier to obtain than H-indices and avoids 
the problem of lack of data that arises from the long time to first citation.

We conducted experiments to investigate the relationship between P-scores and H-indices
in conference rankings. In particular, we wanted to estimate the degree of correlation between both metrics. The data set consists of 882 Computer Science conferences
for which the H5 metric was available on Google Scholar~\footnote{https://scholar.google.com.br/}
in 2012. P-scores were calculated with
data obtained from DBLP \footnote{http://dblp.uni-trier.de/}. The reference set of research groups
was selected through the randomization process described in the previous section, 
yielding the 12 departments listed in table \ref{tab:departments}.

\end{subfigure}  
\caption{Normal probability plots.}
\end{figure}

We first plotted normal probability plots for P-scores and H-indices in our conference data set 
to identify any departures from normality. A normal probability plot shows the theoretical Z-scores
according to the standard normal quantile function on the horizontal axis. For example, at the 90th
percentile (the value below which 90\% of the observations will fall), the normal distribution has a
Z-score of 1.28, meaning that the distribution value at this point is 1.28 standard deviations above the median value. On the vertical axis, if
we plot the Z-scores according to the quantile function described by our sample, we can verify
whether it is consistent with a sample from a normal distribution.

We compared theoretical and sample Z-scores for 882 quantiles (one for each data point) in Figures
\ref{fig:hindex_normality} and \ref{fig:pscore_normality}. The dotted line is the identity line for
which sample and theoretical Z-scores converge. As becomes clear from the plots, both distributions
are significantly skewed, indicating that P-scores and H-indices do not follow normal
distributions. This restricts the application of correlation measures such as Pearson's Product 
Moment Correlation in our analysis, since it requires that variables be approximately normally 
distributed. 

For this reason, we chose the Kendall-Tau coefficient to
study the correlation 
between H-index and P-score. It is a measure of rank
correlation that assumes a value between
-1 and 1. It is higher when observations have similar
ranks, assuming a value of 1
when two rankings are identical and -1 when they are the inverse of each other. 
A Kendall-Tau coefficient close to zero indicates
that both rankings are uncorrelated~\cite{Kendall1955, Baeza-Yates2011}.

\end{figure}

Consider two conference rankings. Figure \ref{fig:pscore_hindex_ranks} shows the ranks of our 882 conferences according to
their P-scores
on the X-axis and their H-indices on the Y-axis. Points that are closer to the origin have better ranks (i.e. a data point at position 1 is better ranked than a data point at position 200).
The plot shows an evident linear correlation between the ranks that is confirmed
by a high Kendall-Tau of 0.5200259445. With a p-value smaller than 0.000001, we can safely reject the null 
hypothesis (that the rankings are uncorrelated) with a reasonable margin.

\section{Assessing conferences in CS}
\label{sec:notifications}

Since P-scores and H-indices are strongly correlated, most data points in our example are clustered close to the identity 
line, showing an apparent agreement between the metrics. However, there are noticeable differences, 
particularly in those cases for which the P-score rank position is high and the H-index rank is low 
(top left corner of Figure \ref{fig:pscore_hindex_ranks}), or for which the H-index rank is high and the 
P-score rank is low (bottom right corner of Figure \ref{fig:pscore_hindex_ranks}). Therefore, we 
can distinguish between three groups of interest in the data set:

We next devise a strategy for delimiting the three sets
above. For this, we draw two line segments, starting from
the origin, separated by an angle $ \theta $, and examine
how the Kendall-Tau coefficient for the data points in the Center Group varies with respect to variations in the angle $ \theta $. It is what we call our "cone strategy", as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cone_strategy}. We immediately notice several data points close to the origin
which are not included in the Center Group. This is a problem, given that these points correspond to CS conferences that have a high H-index rank and a high
P-score rank and thus, are strongly correlated. To
correct this, we move the vertex of the cone, which we also
refer to as the pivot, to a point behind the origin, one
such as (-100, -100), as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cone_strategy_adapted}. By doing so, we ensure that all data points near the origin are included in the
Center Group.

Table \ref{tab:cone_strategy} describes how the Kendall-Tau coefficients vary for items in the Center Group, as we vary the angle $ \theta $, with the pivot positioned behind the origin, as in Figure \ref{fig:cone_strategy_adapted}. We notice that for $ \theta = 20^{\circ} $, 616 conferences are included in the Center
Group (close to 70\% of all conferences in the data set) and, that is accomplished with a very high Kendall-Tau 
coefficient (i.e. above 0.7). Thus, in our subsequent 
analysis, we employed the cone strategy with $ \theta = 20^{\circ} $, since it provides a good trade off between correlation and coverage in our data set.

  \caption{Conferences (short names) ranked by P-score in the bottom, center and top groups.}
  \label{tab:conferences}
\end{table}

With the cone pivot positioned at (-100, -100) and $ \theta=20^{\circ} $, the Top Group ended with 127 conferences, the 
Center Group with 616 conferences, and the Bottom Group with 139 conferences. Table 
\ref{tab:conferences} presents the top 30 conferences, ranked by P-score, for each of our three groups.

The Center Group consists of conferences that have a high correlation between reputation and
popularity. The reputation of these conferences is well represented by the number of citations
they receive. This group represents conferences that are relatively easy to classify regarding
their scientific impact. Among them we find WWW, CVPR and KDD, to name a few.

The Top Group consists of conferences with a high P-score rank and low H-index rank. While these conferences
receive a relatively low number of citations, reputable researchers (i.e. our reference set of top researchers in Computer Science) still publish 
in them consistently, as we can observe from their high P-score ranks. The primary reason is that
conferences in the Top Group are usually venues associated with smaller subareas of Computer Science, and therefore venues that receive a smaller
number of citations. Because of that, their H-indices tend to be smaller and their H-index rank positions tend to be worse. Despite that, many of these venues might have a high reputation in their subareas and thus, high P-scores. 
For example, ICPP, SPAA, LCPC and PPSC are conferences related to parallel processing that capture
considerable attention from the top CS departments, as we can observe from their high P-scores. However,
due to their modest H-indices, they may end up being neglected by funding councils and committees in
their assessment. The total number of publications in Parallel Processing is comparatively low 
compared to other subareas of Computer Science such as Algorithms or Database Management Systems~\cite{Hoonlor2013}. So, it is reasonable to assume that conferences 
in this subarea are expected to receive fewer citations than their counterparts in more popular subareas.
P-scores can assist human evaluators with funding decisions by shedding light to these conferences.

The Bottom Group consists of conferences with a low P-score rank and high H-index rank. These conferences
receive a high number of citations, but their reputation among top computer scientists is comparatively low, as reflected by their P-scores. Conferences in this
group are usually situated in the intersection between Computer Science and other areas of knowledge. Some examples of such venues are
ISMB, GECCO and PSB, which are related to Biocomputing, ISMIR, which is related to Music Information Retrieval, and
ISCAS, and VTC which are related to Engineering and Electronics. Because these are large research communities, venue H-indices tend to be 
relatively high (particularly with regard to Computer Science). In the case of these events, funding councils in Computer Science should consider not only the high H-indexes, but also the venue reputation among computer
scientists. Indeed, an exceptionally popular and reputable conference in electronics may not be as 
popular or prestigious when considering it through the angle of computer scientists. That is, P-scores may aid 
human evaluators with funding decisions by pinpointing conferences that intersect multiple areas of knowledge and by providing
an estimate of the conference's reputation among peers in the field of interest.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have compared the P-scores and H-indices of 882 conferences in Computer Science. 
We have found that P-scores and H-indices have a very high correlation reflected by a Kendall-Tau of 
approximately 0.52. However,
we have also found important differences between the two metrics.
Our interpretation of these results are based on the intuition that while H-indices provide a quantification of the popularity of a publication or researcher among their peers, P-scores provide a quantification of the reputation of a publication or researcher among peers. We can then distinguish three separate cases. First, when P-scores and H-indices are strongly correlated, we have venues that are popular and of high reputation among computer scientists. Second, when P-scores are large (better rank position) and H-indices are small (worse rank position) we have venues of good reputation among computer scientists that are associated with small research communities or subareas. Third, when P-scores are small (worse rank position) and H-indices are large, we have venues of good popularity (usually associated with large research communities outside Computer Science) that do not count with high reputation among computer scientists (in the sense that they do not publish frequently there).
These differences indicate a complementary aspect to the metrics. P-scores, used in conjunction with H-indices, allow distinguishing the three distinct types of venues mentioned above. This provides useful information which
can be employed
by research funding councils and committees to better understand 
the scientific relevance of venues and researchers and thus, take more informed funding decisions.
